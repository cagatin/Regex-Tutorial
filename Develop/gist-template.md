## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my **Regular Expressions** tutorial! In this tutorial, we will be going over what a **regex** is, along with how to use it in our **Javascript** code! Now, get comfortable, and let us learn together!

## Summary

### What is a Regex?
A **Regex**, or **Regular Expression**, is a search pattern primarily used to match a series of character combinations found within string. When included in code, a **Regex** could be particularly helpful in finding certain characters, sequences of characters, or input string validation. 

### Example: Email Validation
To illustrate what a Regex is, let us look at one of the most commonly used regex patterns - email validation!
```
const emailRegex = /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/;
```
What this means exactly is not important for now (We will understand this regex more as we progress through this tutorial). What is important understand, however, is that a regex is enclosed within two forward slashes ```//```.

The general syntax to denote the start and end of a regex is as follows: <br>
```
const myRegex = /<regex expression goes here>/;
```
